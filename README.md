# University-Personnel-Management-System
 Developed a comprehensive Java program to manage university personnel, demonstrating the use of inheritance, abstract classes, and method overriding. 
 
 The project involved:

● Object-Oriented Design: Implemented a class hierarchy with Person as an abstract base class and subclasses Student and Employee. Further, Employee is subclassed into Faculty and Staff.

● Data Management: Stored relevant information for each class, such as full name, ID, GPA, credit hours for students, and department, rank, or status for employees.

● Inheritance and Polymorphism: Demonstrated inheritance by sharing common attributes and methods, and polymorphism by overriding the abstract method print() to generate detailed reports for each type of person.

● Tuition Calculation: Included a method within the Student class to generate a tuition invoice, applying discounts for high GPA.
Data Structures: Used an array to manage up to 100 Person objects, allowing the storage and manipulation of Student, Faculty, and Staff instances in a single collection.

● Exception Handling: Implemented robust exception handling for invalid inputs and duplicate IDs.

● User Interaction: Designed a command-line interface for users to add, view, delete, and generate reports on university personnel.
